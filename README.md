# GatsbyJS Source Plugin for Agility CMS
This is the offical Agility CMS source plugin for GatsbyJS.

## Example
For an example on how this can be used in a website see [Agility CMS GatsbyJS Starter](https://github.com/agility/agility-gatsby-starter).

## Usage
Install it:
```
npm install --save @agility/gatsby-source-agilitycms
```

Ensure you have a `gatsby-config.js` file in the root of your website and set the following:
```javascript
/**
 * Configure your Gatsby site with this file.
 *
 * See: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/
 */

 module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "@agility/gatsby-source-agilitycms", //the name of the plugin
      options: {
        guid: "046a1a87", //your Agility Content Fetch API Guid
        apiKey: "defaultlive.2b7f3a91559d794bedb688358be5e13af2b1e3ae8cd39e8ed2433bbef5d8d6ac", //your Agility Content Fetch API Key
        isPreview: false, //set this to true if you are using your preview API Key
        sharedContent: ['posts', 'globalheader'], //a list of reference names you want to include in your GraphQL store
        languages: [ 'en-us' ], //the languages you want to include
        channels: [ 'website' ], //the channels you want to include
        defaultPageTemplate: './src/templates/AgilityPage.js', //the page template that will be used to render Agility CMS pages
        indexPage: '/home' //If you want an Agility CMS page to be your home page (i.e. '/home' to be used as '/'), set the page path here
    },
  ],
}
```
